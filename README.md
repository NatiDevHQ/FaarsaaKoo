## 🎨 Customize Your Experience

### Add New Songs

Add your favorite songs by editing `src/data/lyricsData.js`. Follow the format below:

```javascript
{
  id: 6,
  title: "Your Song Title",
  artist: "Artist Name",
  album: "Album Name",
  lyrics: "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3",  // Use \n for line breaks
  year: 2023,
  genre: "Genre",
  coverArt: "https://link-to-image.jpg",
  duration: "3:45"
}
```

### Styling Tips

* Component styles live inside each component’s folder for easy updates.
* Global styles are in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`.
* Dark mode is handled with the `.dark` CSS class. Example:

```css
/* Light mode */
.lyric-card {
  background-color: #fff;
}

/* Dark mode */
.dark .lyric-card {
  background-color: #1f2937;
}
```

Feel free to tweak colors, fonts, or layouts to match your style!
